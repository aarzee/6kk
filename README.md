2. Open a command prompt window and type this command to install dependencies:`pip install colorama psutil`

The script will launch SUPERHOT automatically.

It will not always find the correct memory location - if you get a blank screen in the command prompt, close the game and termninate the script (Ctrl+C in the command prompt) and try again.
